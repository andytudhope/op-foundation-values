# OP Foundation Values

A simple one-page web app to showcase the Optimism Foundations Values and enable anyone who resonates with them to sign them by minting an NFT on Optimism.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

The contract is included, along with the metadata which is stored at the public hash, for reference. Use whatever tool you prefer to work with that if needed.
